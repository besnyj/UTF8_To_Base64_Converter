Classes and its methods:

    Class Button
        - handles the functions of for the buttons.
        - contains the virtual methods ClickToCopy(), ClickToConvert(), ClickToRevert().
        
    Class CopyButton
        - inherits from the class Button.
        - handles the functions for the Copy button.
        - ClickToCopy() -> takes in a string and transfer the data in the BASE64TextBox to the system's clipboard.
        
    Class EnterButton
        - inherits from the class Button.
        - handles the functions for the Enter button.
            - as the Enter button is not present in the software anymore, it handles the functions for when the "Enter" key
            is pressed while texting in the UTF8TextBox.
        - ClickToConvert() -> takes in a string and returns a from UTF8 to BASE64 converted string using EncodeToBase64()
        method from the Converters class.
        - ClickToRevert() -> takes in a string and returns a from BASE64 to UTF8 converted string using the DecodeToUTF8()
        method from the Converters class.
    
    Class Converters
        - serves as the container for the conversion methods.
        - EncodeToBase64() -> takes in a string, uses the Encoding class to transform the text into a byte array. Then,
        uses the Convert class to store the converted array as a string in a new variable and returns it.
        - DecodeToUTF8() -> takes in a string, uses the Convert class to transform the text into a byte array. Then, uses
        the Encoding class to store the converted array as a string in a new variable and returns it.
    
    Enum State
        - enumerates the two different possible states of conversion methods: utf8 to base64 and reverse.
        The default value is Encode.

Form methods:

    SwapButton_Click() -> handles the swapping option to select between encode and decode. It checks the current state
    of the _swapState variable and then changes to the contrasting state, also making changes in the design accordingly
    to the chosen option.
    
    CopyButton_Click() -> Copies the text from the bottom text box to the system's clipboard.
    
    UTF8TextBox_KeyDown() -> handles the text conversion. When the enter key is pressed, the method calls ClickToConvert()
    or ClickToRevert() from the EnterButton class. It checks for the _swapState state. Also, handles the error in case 
    the user inputs a string which length is not a multiple of 4.
